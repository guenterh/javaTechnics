# Goals #
 
* All our RDF transformations should be performed with Metafacture / Metamorph 
* Ideas behind this approach for transformations: 
1. Metadata specialists should be able to define the concepts in an abstract way without the need to think about implementation in any programing language
similar as described in http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may15/boehme/05boehme.html Introduction:Transparency 
2. Additional goals are described in: General requirements for future tools and the infrastructure to be created by linked.swissbib.ch (and swissbib classic)

# done so far #

* we created transformations for
    * bibliographic resources 
        * https://github.com/linked-swissbib/mfWorkflows/tree/master/src/main/resources/transformation/resource
    * person entities 
        * https://github.com/linked-swissbib/mfWorkflows/tree/master/src/main/resources/transformation/person
        * https://github.com/linked-swissbib/mfWorkflows/blob/master/src/main/resources/transformation/person/personMorph.xml
        * outputexample: 
    * organizations
        * https://github.com/linked-swissbib/mfWorkflows/blob/master/src/main/resources/transformation/organisation/organisationMorph.xml
        
    * work entities
        * https://github.com/linked-swissbib/mfWorkflows/tree/master/src/main/resources/transformation/work
        * these entities are based on so called FRBR clusters created by our CBS data hub
        * outputexample: https://github.com/linked-swissbib/mfWorkflows/blob/master/src/main/resources/transformation/work/workOutput.rdf
    * item data (work in progress)
        * https://github.com/linked-swissbib/mfWorkflows/tree/master/src/main/resources/transformation/item

### lessons learned
#### Metamorph transformations with a focus on RDF/XML or JSON-LD
* in a first step all our Metamorph transformations were serialized in RDF/XML.     
Because we use Elasticsearch as data store an additional transformation to JSON-LD had to be done in a subsequent Metafacture module. 
This is resource intensive and unnecessary. Therefor we changed the transformations in a way which makes it easier for the next module to create JSON (ES Bulk structures)
